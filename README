In the framework there are two parts Java and resource.
In the resource part, I added a config folder where I have config.properties file in which I stored information about which browser and url I used.
The features folder is where I wrote the test case using Gherkin language.
The other part of the framework is the Java part where I have pages, runners, steps, and utils.
In the pages folder, that is where I stored the webelements needed for the test case.
In the runners folder, that is where I would run the test case.
In the steps, that is where I have the codes needed for the automation.
In the utils is where I stored Common methods needed to avoid code redundancy
Config reader is also stored in utils and that is where the code is to read what is written in the config.properties file
Since this framework has separate folder and files from each other, it is easier to edit if there are any changes in the project.
To run the project go into src folder > test > java > runners > RunnerClass then click the green play button.
if the test case passes then it will say on the console that the test passed.
if the test case fails then it will show on the console the result on why it failed.
